Small project with the intention of being an online multiplayer web version of the popular card game Big Two.

The game is currently live and playable at [this website](websocketbig2.herokuapp.com/)!

You can read details about the card game and how to play it on its [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_two).

Planned features:
* Display all players' remaining cards after game end
* If a player has four 2s, they should automatically win
* Potentially count remaining cards to assign scores to players
